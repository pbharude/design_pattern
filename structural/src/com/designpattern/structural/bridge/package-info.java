/**
 * Design Pattern : Bridge
 * 
 * Concepts:
 *  Decouple Abstraction and Implementation
 *  Encapsulation, Composition, Inheritance
 *  Changes in Abstraction won't affect client
 *  Details won't be right
 *  Examples:
 * 	 Driver
 *   JDBC
 * 
 * Design:
 *  Interfaces and Abstract classes
 *  Composition over Inheritance
 *  More than Composition
 *  Expect change from both sides
 *  Abstraction, Implementor, Refined Abstraction, Concrete Implementor
 *  
 * Pitfalls:
 * 	Increases complexity
 *  Conceptually difficult to plan
 *  More than OO
 *  What goes where
 *  
 * Contrast:
 * 
 * Bridge
 *  Designed upfront
 *  Abstraction and implementation vary
 *  Built in advance
 *  Complex
 *  Both adapt multiple systems
 * 
 * Adapter
 * 	Works after code is designed
 *  Legacy
 *  Retrofitted
 *  Provides different interface
 *
