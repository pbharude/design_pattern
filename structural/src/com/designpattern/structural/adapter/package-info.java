/**
 * Design Pattern : Adapter
 * 
 * Concepts:
 *  Plug adaptor
 *  Convert interface to another interface
 *  legacy 
 *  Translates requests
 *  Client, Adapter, Adaptee
 *  Examples:
 * 	 Arrays-> Lists
 * 	 Streams
 * 
 * Design:
 *  Client centric
 *  Integrate new with old
 *  Interface, but not required
 *  Adaptee can be the implementation
 *  
 * Pitfalls:
 * 	Not a lot
 *  Don't complicate
 *  Multiple Adapters
 *  Don't add functionality
 *  
 * Contrast:
 * 
 * Adapter
 * 	Works after code is designed
 *  Legacy
 *  Retrofitted
 *  Provides different interface
 * 
 * Bridge
 *  Designed upfront
 *  Abstraction and implementation vary
 *  Built in advance
 *  Both adapt multiple systems
